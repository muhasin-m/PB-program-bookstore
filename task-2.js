    Task 2:
    You receive a report with the sales from the Sci-fi department and the Crime department.
    You want to check that the sales of at least one of the two departments are within a certain range, otherwise it's bad news for the store 

    - write an if...else statement that prints true if at least one of the 2 sales amount is in the range between 200 and 500, false otherwise
    - test with different values
