    Task 4:
    This year, two departments have gone pretty well in your store: cooking books and drawing books.
    You want to check if both of them managed to sell more than 300 units each.

    - write an if...else statement that prints true if the 2 sales amounts are both greater than 300, false otherwise
    - test with different values
